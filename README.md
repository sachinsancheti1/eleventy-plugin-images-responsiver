**`eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver` is a simple solution for most responsive images needs with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)**.

It allows authors to use the simple and standard Markdown syntax for images (`![alt text](image.jpg "title text")`) and yet get responsive images in the generated HTML, with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.

Responsive Images are difficult to implement, but they're **required to provide a good performance to Web users**.

Knowing that [`<picture>` is only required for rare advanced usages](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/dont-use-picture-most-of-the-time/), **`eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver` should be enough for most use cases**.

`eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver` is "just" a thin layer between Eleventy plugin and transformations system and [images-responsiver](https://github.com/nhoizey/images-responsiver), a generic HTML transformation Node.js module for simple responsive images.
