# Step 0: Get the resources to follow this tutorial

Get the sources from the repository. You can either:

1. Download [a zip of the whole directory](https://github.com/nhoizey/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver/archive/master.zip) and unzip it
1. or clone it with Git into your local folder (change `my-local-folder` to what you want):
   `git clone git@github.com:nhoizey/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver.git my-local-folder`

Then go into the first example folder with your terminal:

```bash
cd my-local-folder/docs/examples/01-without-plugin
```

Then, let's go for **[step 1](https://nhoizey.github.io/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver/examples/01-without-plugin/)**!
