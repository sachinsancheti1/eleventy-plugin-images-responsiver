# Step 5: Presets

## Run it

In the folder of the tutorial step, run a clean install then build in developer mode:

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

Sources are in `src/` and build result is in `dist/`.

## Check the result

If you open `http://localhost:8080/` in a browser, all images are still there, and should weight much less! ðŸ’ª

Nothing changed visualy.

<!-- TODO: add comparision of images/pages weights -->

## How does it work?

To make sure the browser knows the width of the image to render, we have to use the `sizes` attribute on each image. We need different `sizes` attribute values for different image use cases.

But we don't want to repeat them for each images, and we want to provide content authors (even if that's us) with something as simple as possible so that they can focus on content.

Let's define **presets**, and configuration options attached to them.

First, we define a `default` preset that will be used for all images where the author doesn't set any preset.

```javascript
const presets = {
  default: {
    sizes: '(max-width: 45em) 90vw, 40em',
  },
};
```

We set the default `sizes` attribute value, considering we will never have any image larger than the content (remember, 90Â % of the viewport but never more than `40em`).

`(max-width: 45em) 90vw, 40em` now overrides the plugin's default value of `100vw`.

We now need to add a specific preset for the logo, which needs a different `sizes` value, because it takes only 20Â % of the content area:

```javascript
const presets = {
  default: {
    sizes: '(max-width: 45em) 90vw, 40em',
  },
  logo: {
    sizes: '(max-width: 45em) 18vw, 8em',
  },
};
```

We then use these `presets` as options for the plugin:

```javascript
eleventyConfig.addPlugin(imagesResponsiver, presets);
```

We also need a way for content authors to specify what preset an image should use, if the default one is not enough. We will use a `data-responsiver` data attribute, with the name of the preset as the value.

Once again, the Markdown-it Attributes plugin helps us. We can change the Markdown for the logo from:

```markdown
![My logo](assets/my-logo.png){.logo}{width=400}{height=400}
```

To:

```markdown
![My logo](assets/my-logo.png){.logo}{width=400}{height=400}{data-responsiver=logo}
```

This syntax is becoming really verbose, but **don't abandon now**, it's really worth it, and we'll see a little later how to make it easier for the content authors!

Check the result of the transformation to see how the images now have different `sizes` attribute values:

You can also check the HTML:

_Note: Each image can use multiple presets in the `data-responsiver` attribute, each value separated by a space (like classes). Settings from each preset surcharges the previous one(s), in the order they're declared._

_To be continuedâ€¦_
