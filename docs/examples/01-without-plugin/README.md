# First example: default behaviour without the plugin

In the folder of the example, run install then build:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Sources are in `src/` and build is in `dist/`.

If you open `dist/index.html` in a browser, both images should be visible.

Now try [the second example](../02-with-plugin-default/)â€¦
